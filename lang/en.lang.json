		"The application aims to support the researcher in analyzing own scientific output. The main problem in Poland concerns great dissemination of bibliographic databases. But one of the fully complementary can be obtained on local level, i.e. university database Expertus.",
		"Publications set is visualized in different ways. Researchers will see the dynamics of their published papers on the timeline, as well as the cumulative ministerial score for each year. They can also analyze personal collaboration network due to multiscale graph. The geography of publishing is presented on a map of Poland, Europe or world depending on localization scope.",
		"Words clouds provide insight into research topics. Technology is based on counting and sorting the frequencies of words; in this case a set of keywords in Polish, and separately in English.",
		"Thus, the scientist could study and analize visually own scientific output for free. He is able to track critical points in his career, minimize excessive variability in publication dynamics. Visualization is supposed to serve as ancillary tool for managing the scientific achievement."
